### Research Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze NYC Yellow Taxi data (July–December 2019), explore the impact of holidays and major events, and build machine learning models to predict trip fares and tipping behavior.

### Timeline
The research focuses on the period from **2019-07 to 2019-12**.

### How to Reproduce the Analysis

**1. Set Up the Data**

Before running the code, you must download the required datasets and place them in the project's root directory according to the following structure:

.└── data/├── yellow_tripdata_2019-07.parquet├── yellow_tripdata_2019-08.parquet├── ... (and so on for all 6 months)└── taxi_zones/├── taxi_zones.shp
* **Taxi Trip Data:** Download the six monthly Parquet files for July–December 2019 from the [official TLC website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and place them inside the `data/` folder.
* **Taxi Zone Shapefiles:** Download the shapefile from [this link](https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/misc/taxi_zones.zip), unzip it, and place the resulting `taxi_zones` folder inside the `data/` folder.

**2. Install Dependencies**

Install all required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file. It is highly recommended to do this in a virtual environment.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Troubleshooting
The geospatial libraries (geopandas, fiona, etc.) can sometimes be difficult to install with pip on its own. If you encounter installation errors, it is recommended to:

Use a Linux environment, such as the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2), as recommended by the course specification.

Alternatively, use an environment manager like Conda which handles complex dependencies more robustly.

3. Run the Notebook
Open and run all cells in the notebooks/Project_code.ipynb notebook sequentially.Output: All figures generated by the notebook will be saved to the data/ directory. Model performance metrics (RMSE, R², AUC, etc.) will be printed directly in the notebook.
